- Mohammad Ali Sadri (@masadri)
- Anna Koval

Goal of project is to predict objectivity of sports articles.

These are the steps we've done:

1. Preprocessing data ([dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sports+articles+for+objectivity+analysis))
2. Visual Analysis
3. Selecting features from dataset with `SelectKBest` and consulting a professional -> results compared
4. Used `GridSearchCV` for finding optimal hyperparameters
5. Comparing results
6. Commenting on how we can improve model

This model has potential to be used in production for predicting objectivity of Sports Articles.
 
**The planned upgrade for this model is to enable web-scaping for various Sports Articles.**
